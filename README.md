# AI101 â€“ Deep Learning Fundamentals

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks developed as part of the AI101 course, focused on understanding and applying fundamental deep learning concepts through hands-on experiments.

## Contents

### 1. `Autoencoder-based-classification.ipynb`
- Built a CNN-based autoencoder on CIFAR-10 for image reconstruction.
- Used the learned encoder as a feature extractor for classification.
- Achieved **95.32% accuracy** on CIFAR-10.

### 2. `Iris-classification.ipynb`
- Implemented a simple vanilla neural network to classify Iris flower species.
- Trained using dense layers with ReLU and softmax activations.
- Achieved **96.7% accuracy** on the Iris dataset.

### 3. `CAR-PUFs.ipynb`
- Modeled Companion Arbiter PUFs (CAR-PUFs) using a linear CSVM.
- Applied polynomial feature expansion and trained on challenge-response pairs.
- Demonstrated hardware security limitations with **99.2% accuracy**.

## Objective

To explore the theoretical and practical foundations of deep learning using core models such as CNNs, autoencoders, and linear classifiers.
